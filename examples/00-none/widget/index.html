        <p>This is a demo without Video Splash Screen configuration.
           This screen should appear when the page is read and the DOM structure is known.
           If there are still some out-of-line elements, like images or async script, they will
           be loaded after this step.</p>

        <img src="res/timeline.svg" style="width:100%">

        <p>The main difference between this example and <code>first-paint</code> Video Splash Screen
           is that no videos are played here before application loads.</p>


        <p>Demo calls <code>console.log</code> at certain points. Visible through DevTools, those
            logs can help see the relationship between splash screen and HTML application.</p>
